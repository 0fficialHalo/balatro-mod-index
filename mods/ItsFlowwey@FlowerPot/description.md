# Flower Pot
Flower Pot is a mod that improves tracking and displaying of player stats

- Player stats can be saved to the "Flower Pot - Stat Files" folder in your save directory, both in .json and .csv format
- "Stats" menu overhauled to allow the full showcase of Joker win counts, Consumable uses, and more. 
- More stats are added and tracked, just as Voucher wins and Joker records.
